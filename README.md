# 42libft
Libft (short for Library Forty-Two) is a C library that contains rewritten versions of current C library functions like atoi and bzero. There are additional custom functions included. The purpose of libft was to learn how to create the library tools from the ground up, while also creating tools to be used for more complicated programs in the future.
